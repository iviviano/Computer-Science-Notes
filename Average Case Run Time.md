mathLink: average case run time
---
>[!def]
>One way to analyze the [[Time Complexity]] of an [[Algorithm]] is to compute its *average-case run time*. 

Notes: 
- This is generally more useful than analyzing [[Worst Case Run Time]]
- It is much harder and more arbitrary to compute the average-case run time
