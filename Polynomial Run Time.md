>[!def]
>Let $c,d>0$ be absolute constants, and let $N$ be an input size. Suppose the [[Worst Case Run Time]] of an [[Algorithm]] is bounded above by 
>$$cN^{d}$$
>[[Primitive Computational Step]]s. We then say that the algorithm has *polynomial running time* and that it is a *polynomial-time algorithm*.
