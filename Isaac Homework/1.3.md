(a) Consider the [[Worst Case Run Time]] that occurs when both numbers are [[String]]s of $n$ $1$s. Then, $2$ bitwise additions are required for each bit after the first and excluding the $n-th$ carry. So, to add the two [[Binary]] numbers, at most $2n$ bitwise additions are required. By the [[Asymptotic Tight Bound for Polynomials Proposition]], this process is $O(n)$.

(b) Let $P(n)$ be the [[Proposition]] $\log(n!)≤\log(n^{n})$. I will prove that $P(n)$ is true for $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
Induction on $n$:
Base case: $n=1$
As $1!=1$ and $1^{1}=1$, $P(1)$ is true.
>
Inductive Step: Let $n\in \mathbb{N}, n≥1$ be given, and assume $P(n)$ is true.
Then, $$\log[(n+1)!]=\log(n+1)+ \log(n!)≤\log(n+1)+ \log(n^{n})$$by the inductive hypothesis. As $\log$ is monotonic, $n\log(n)\le n\log(n+1)$. So,  $$\log(n+1)\log(n^{n})≤\log(n+1)+\log(n+1)^{n}=\log(n+1)^{n+1}$$so, $P(n+1)$.
[[therefore]] by [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]], for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$, $\log(n!)≤\log(n^{n})$.

(c) If $n_{0}=1$ and $c=100$, for all $n≥n_{0}$, $c\cdot (2n+3)≥5n$

(d) If $n_{0}=1$ and $c=1$, for all $n≥n_{0}$, $c\cdot(5n)≥2n+3$
