(a) Here is a counterexample for $n=3$. Let $w=(3,2,1),h=(1,2,1)$. The given [[Greedy Paradigm]] [[Algorithm]] will pick rectangle $1$, the widest, and then finish as neither of the others nests inside. The correct solution is to pick rectangle $2$ first as this allows $3$ to nest inside.

(b) Here is a counterexample for $n=3$. Let $w=(10,2,1),h=(1,2,1)$. The given [[Greedy Paradigm]] [[Algorithm]] will pick rectangle $1$, the largest perimeter, and then finish as neither of the others nests inside. The correct solution is to pick rectangle $2$ first as this allows $3$ to rest inside.
