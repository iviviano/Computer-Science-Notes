>[!note]
>It is hard to define *efficiency* because it encompasses so many attributes of an [[Algorithm]] and which ones are important depends on the problem at hand. Here are a few metrics to think about what can make an [[Algorithm]] efficient.

>[!def]
>An [[Algorithm]] is *efficient* if, when implemented, it runs quickly on real input instances.

>[!def]
>An [[Algorithm]] is *efficient* if it achieves qualitatively better [[Worst Case Run Time]], at an analytical level, than the [[Brute Force Benchmark]].

>[!def]
>An [[Algorithm]] is *efficient* if it is a [[Polynomial Run Time]].

One advantage of this definition is we can say that there is no efficient algorithm to solve a given problem.
