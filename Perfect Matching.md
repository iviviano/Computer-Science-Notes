>[!def]
> A *perfect matching* $S'$ is a [[matching]] with the property that each member of $M$ and each member of $W$ appears in exactly one pair in $S'$, where  the [[set]] $M = \{m_1,..., m_n\}$ of $n$ men, and a [[set]] $W = \{w_1,...,w_n\}$ of $n$ women. 

>[!note]
> This is a special case of [[matching]]. This example pairs men $m$ in $M$ with women $w$ in $W$.
