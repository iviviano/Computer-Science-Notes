mathLink: divide and conquer
---

Strategy:
1. Break the problem into subproblems that are smaller instances of the original problem
2. [[Recursive]]ly solve these subproblems (starting with base case-smallest possible subproblem)
3. Appropriately combine the answers to the subproblems


Examples:
1. [[Merge-Sort]]
2. [[Quick-Sort]]
3. 

Challenges: 
1. [[Recursive]] thinking
2. Correctness (use [[Principle of Mathematical Induction]])
3. [[Tractability]]? ([[Worst Case Run Time]] and [[Efficiency]])
