>[!def]
> A *matching* $S$ is a [[Set]] of ordered pairs, each from $M\times W$, with the property that each member of $M$ and each member of $W$ appears in at most one pair in $S$.

A matching is [[Stable]] if it is: 
- a [[Perfect Matching]]
- there is no instability with respect to $S$
It is possible for an instance to have more than one stable matching.
